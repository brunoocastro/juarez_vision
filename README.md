# Juarez Vision Controller

My first image processing project to LARC 2019 (Latin American Robotics Competition), when we participated by @TauraBots (Robotics group of UFSM) with Juarez (Our ROBOTIS OP3 Robot)

Thats made with Python and OpenCV. It will controll the robot to stay between two lines (lane delimiters) while run to the finish.
